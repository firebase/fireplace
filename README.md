# Firereader

Firereader is a fully functional, real-time content aggregator built using [Angular](http://www.angularjs.org) and [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com).

It contains a fully functional client in the app/ directory, and a service that parses RSS data and pushes it into Firebase in the service/ directory.

## Installation

To install a Firereader service, follow these steps:
* open app/js/config.js and set the `FIREBASE_URL` to your namespace
* cd into service/
* run `npm install` to configure dependencies
* start feeds.js: `FBURL="https://<NAMESPACE>.firebaseio.com/user" SECRET="xxx" node ./feeds.js`

Firereader was built using [angularFire](https://github.com/firebase/angularFire) as a demo app. If you are looking for a working example project to build AngularFire apps, check out [AngularFire-seed](https://github.com/firebase/angularFire-seed)!
